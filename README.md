# OSX Defaults
A place to centralize the great work [@mathiasbynens](http://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/master/.osx) did gathering and foster a community around finding and documenting OSX Default configuation from the command-line.

Want to see *all*, and I mean **ALL** of the Default values on your system?
Open up your command line and type the following:

`defaults read > ~/defaults.json`

Just want the values for a specific application? 

`defaults read -app iTerm`
